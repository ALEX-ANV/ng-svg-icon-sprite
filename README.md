# SVG-Icon-Sprite Package for Angular (>= 2)

## Usage



__Note:__ you need to create the sprites directory before running the npm script (for svg sprite creation)

## Local Development vs. Package

This git repository contains all development files for the ng-icon-sprite package while npm library only includes the
TypeScript library in Angular package format. The latter can be generated into a dist folder using ng-packagr (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-packagr)
by running ng-packagr -p ng-package.json
